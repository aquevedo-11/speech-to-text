1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
I've always wanted to start a business that not only made money or grew, but also more

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,680
importantly added value to the planet.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,960
A trailblazer is someone who only cares about one thing and that is pursuing their passion.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,440
And when we started 10 years ago, selling ugly fruits and vegetables online was a crazy

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
idea.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,160
Hungry Harvest is on a mission to fight food waste and fight hunger.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,720
What we do is we source produce that otherwise would go to waste because it's odd size or

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,640
shape, all perfectly fresh, perfectly nutritious, and we sell it via e-commerce.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,960
When customers sign up for Hungry Harvest, they're reducing food waste, they're helping

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,360
subsidized produce and other food for folks that are living in food deserts, and they're

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,360
helping invest in the local economy.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,280
In my opinion, we're just getting started.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,880
For every trailblazer, they've never really reached their end goal.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,080
It's always kind of a pursuit and journey.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
I'm Evan Lutz.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm the CEO and founder of Hungry Harvest, and I'm a University of Maryland graduate.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,640
Go Turks!
