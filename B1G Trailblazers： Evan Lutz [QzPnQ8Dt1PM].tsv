0	6040	I've always wanted to start a business that not only made money or grew, but also more
6040	9680	importantly added value to the planet.
9680	14960	A trailblazer is someone who only cares about one thing and that is pursuing their passion.
14960	19440	And when we started 10 years ago, selling ugly fruits and vegetables online was a crazy
19440	20440	idea.
20440	24160	Hungry Harvest is on a mission to fight food waste and fight hunger.
24160	27720	What we do is we source produce that otherwise would go to waste because it's odd size or
27720	33640	shape, all perfectly fresh, perfectly nutritious, and we sell it via e-commerce.
33640	36960	When customers sign up for Hungry Harvest, they're reducing food waste, they're helping
36960	41360	subsidized produce and other food for folks that are living in food deserts, and they're
41360	44360	helping invest in the local economy.
44360	46280	In my opinion, we're just getting started.
46280	49880	For every trailblazer, they've never really reached their end goal.
49880	53080	It's always kind of a pursuit and journey.
53080	54080	I'm Evan Lutz.
54080	59040	I'm the CEO and founder of Hungry Harvest, and I'm a University of Maryland graduate.
59040	59640	Go Turks!
