I've always wanted to start a business that not only made money or grew, but also more

00:06.040 --> 00:09.680
importantly added value to the planet.

00:09.680 --> 00:14.960
A trailblazer is someone who only cares about one thing and that is pursuing their passion.

00:14.960 --> 00:19.440
And when we started 10 years ago, selling ugly fruits and vegetables online was a crazy

00:19.440 --> 00:20.440
idea.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.160
Hungry Harvest is on a mission to fight food waste and fight hunger.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.720
What we do is we source produce that otherwise would go to waste because it's odd size or

00:27.720 --> 00:33.640
shape, all perfectly fresh, perfectly nutritious, and we sell it via e-commerce.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.960
When customers sign up for Hungry Harvest, they're reducing food waste, they're helping

00:36.960 --> 00:41.360
subsidized produce and other food for folks that are living in food deserts, and they're

00:41.360 --> 00:44.360
helping invest in the local economy.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.280
In my opinion, we're just getting started.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.880
For every trailblazer, they've never really reached their end goal.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.080
It's always kind of a pursuit and journey.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
I'm Evan Lutz.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.040
I'm the CEO and founder of Hungry Harvest, and I'm a University of Maryland graduate.

00:59.040 --> 00:59.640
Go Turks!
